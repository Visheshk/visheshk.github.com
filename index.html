<a name="welcome-to-vishesh-kumars-github-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-vishesh-kumars-github-page"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Vishesh Kumar's github page.</h3>

<p>Alternate to the normal homepage/portfolio page <a href="http://www.visheshk.net">here</a>, and additional to the <a href="http://www.visheshk.net/Vishesh_Kumar-Resume.pdf">Resume</a>.
Here's a bunch of projects, often half-baked, most of them still in the oven. (Including this page, most probably.)</p>

<p>In chronological order, from newest to oldest.</p>

<h2>
<a name="ethers-games-data-analysis" class="anchor" href="#ethers-games-data-analysis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYiHvo9RDwAkcTFrZnh2s3nvhqXa61D_6Z_-xO520iA/pub">Ethers Games' Data Analysis</a>
</h2>

<p>Worked on a project aimed at designing an assessment system, to identify and gauge Iridescent's traits (Persistence, Creativity, etc.), in players of the <a href="http://www.iridescentlearning.org/programs/ethers-games/">Ethers Games</a>. I mostly worked on understanding, extracting meaning from, and trying to make measurable sense of play data we had of the games' play – a detailed report of all the work over the summer is in the linked title. This work was done over the summer of 2014 (May-July) as remote internship with Iridescent Learning, with a lot of active guidance from Kevin Miklasz.  //using R for lots of graphs and data compilation &amp; analyses.</p>

<h2>
<a name="musicode" class="anchor" href="#musicode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://github.com/Visheshk/musicode-tangible">Musicode</a>
</h2>

<p>A music programming puzzle game. One half Logo for music making, and one half Robozzle for music making puzzles. Began programming <a href="http://visheshk.github.io/Musicode">version 0.1</a> (&lt;-the link includes an attempt to a background description to what, and why we were making) from 17-26 February, 2014. Version 0.2 (linked in the title) began in early March – temporarily concluded and sketchily tested by 23 May, 2014. Done in a team of 4, as our 6th semester's design project. //using paper.js for v0.1, and Processing &amp; MaKeyMaKey for v0.2</p>

</h2>

<p>Why, you ask? Because we can! 15 February, 2014 – with Harshit and Sanjana.</p>

<h2>
<a name="shadows" class="anchor" href="#shadows"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://visheshk.github.io/shadows/">Shadows</a>
</h2>

<p>Intended to be an interactive simulation set for seeing projections of objects in fewer dimensions than they exist in. Currently only shows the shadow for a cube. Hopefully to be extended soon.
Made in 2-3 hours shortly preceding the dawn of 17 February, 2014. Solo project, part of a class assignment in an oblique manner. //using paper.js</p>

<h2>
<a name="singlini" class="anchor" href="#singlini"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://buildinprogress.herokuapp.com/projects/708/steps">Singlini</a>
</h2>

<p>A mechanical musical sequencer, also describe-able as a customizable wind chime. Built over a week (27 Jan - 2 Feb, 2014) at the MIT DI 2014 workshop, in a team of 4. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1y22AIF-_w">Here's</a> a video of the final prototype.  //using lots of hands, and very little software</p>

<h2>
<a name="ixda-challenge" class="anchor" href="#ixda-challenge"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-P5Nxk-ERE">IxDA Challenge</a>
</h2>

<p>Made for the <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/about/student-design-challenge/">IxDA 2014 Student Design Challenge</a>, with Safinah. Over 2 weeks of discussions and work preceding the deadline in early December 2013.</p>

<a name="savor" class="anchor" href="#savor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8dEH-aRnrIXNmZpMGRjbjhPZGs&amp;usp=drive_web">Savor</a>
</h2>

<p>Course (September-November 2013) project on Interaction Design, designed in a team of 5.</p>

<h2>
<a name="colorave" class="anchor" href="#colorave"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://visheshk.github.io/colorave">Colorave</a>
</h2>

<p>A tangible tool/toy, built with the aim of helping visualize the correlation between the waveform (and associated characteristics/definition) of light and the color it corresponds to. Led to a flurry of discussion, conflict, learning of my own, and a second iteration. Hopefully to go some place more interesting as well.
Two version built over two different days of involved work, September 15 and October 6, 2013.
Built solo, apart from lots of useful discussions with friends, and learning from different people about how the Fourier transform works, and what that means here. //Using Processing.</p>

<h2>
<a name="velocity" class="anchor" href="#velocity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://visheshk.github.io/velocity">Velocity</a>
</h2>

<p>Aimed to be an initial experimental simulation to see how a toy that measures relative velocity of toy cars and objects, would help in making sense of the concept of relative velocity for the player/learner.
Simulation felt disappointing as it appeared to not help in any realization of useful knowledge, and the project was left hanging over there.
Solo project begun and abandoned around August 8, 2013. //Using paper.js.</p>

<h2>
<a name="giant-steps-for-algebra" class="anchor" href="#giant-steps-for-algebra"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://art.visheshk.net/gs">Giant Steps for Algebra</a>
</h2>

<p>Github link <a href="http://github.com/Visheshk/giant-steps">here</a>. A learning science research project, of graduate student Kiera Chase, under Professor Dor Abrahamson, designed for sense-making of algebraic operations in pre-algebra students, using a metaphor of giant steps and their journeys in a desert. Done in the summer of 2013, along with fellow intern (co designer and researcher) Rishika Jain, at the Embodied Design Research Laboratory (EDRL). //Developed using JavaScript (a library called Paper.js for the most part).</p>

<h2>
<a name="sur-real" class="anchor" href="#sur-real"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://github.com/Visheshk/sur-real">Sur-real</a>
</h2>

<p>A basic prototype of a project aimed to identify gestures (of the scratch and tap variety), made on surfaces, suing a microphone. A la Chris Harrison's Scratch Input. Built over a week - 22-26 January, 2013 - at the MIT DI 2013 workshop, in a team of 5. //Using Processing</p>

<h2>
<a name="braillekey" class="anchor" href="#braillekey"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://github.com/Visheshk/braillekey">BrailleKey</a>
</h2>

<p>A design research/HCI project on designing an alternate Braille keyboard mobile application. Prototyped on Android, tested, and published in IHCI 2012. With Nikhil Siva and Siddhartha Nambiar, over October-December 2012. //Made on Android</p>

<h2>
<a name="hex" class="anchor" href="#hex"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://github.com/Visheshk/Hex">Hex</a>
</h2>

<p>An Android (2 human player) game, made over one day (some hackathon), in October 2012, with Siddhartha Ancha, on the popular mathematical game Hex. Yet to merge with the extended version where an (almost) always winning AI has been made by Shreyas, and Siddhartha. //Made on Android - using the usual Java, Android SDK hocus.</p>
